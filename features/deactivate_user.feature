Feature: deactivate user
  As a environment admin
  I want to be able  deactivate my account
  So that user data remains persisted and allows the reactivation of the account

  Background:
    Given "MpogSoftwarePlugin" plugin is enabled
    And I am logged in as admin
    And I go to /admin/plugins
    And I check "MpogSoftwarePlugin"
    And I press "Save changes"
    And I go to /account/logout
    And the following users
      | login      | name        | email                  |
      | joaosilva  | Joao Silva  | joaosilva@example.com  |
    And I am logged in as "joaosilva"

    And I follow "Edit Profile"
    And I follow "Delete profile"
    And I follow "Yes, I am sure"
    Then I am not logged in
    When I go to /profile/joaosilva
